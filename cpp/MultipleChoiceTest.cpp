/*

Question is from testdome.com

Multiple choice test has several multiple choice questions. Each question can have only 
one correct answer. Additionally, timed multiple choice test can specify the time allowed 
for solving each question in the test.

The code below satisfies this specification, but the customer complained that the memory usage 
of the program constantly increases. Fix this problem.
Ans: Destructor was missing from the code.
